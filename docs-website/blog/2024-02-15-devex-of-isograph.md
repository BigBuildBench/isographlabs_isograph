Please check out this [video showing off the DevEx of using Isograph](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgEbkH50GLo) that I recorded with [Lenny Garcia Crespo](https://twitter.com/leogcrespo)! In this video, we use Isograph to build an app powered by the GitHub GraphQL API that lists your repositories, and can be used to add and remove stars.

This video follows the work done in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6vYKhF99Us), in which I built an app that authenticates with the GitHub OAuth API. This video isn't necessary to watch to understand the DevEx video.

The repository can be found [here](https://github.com/isographlabs/demo-2024-01-22).
