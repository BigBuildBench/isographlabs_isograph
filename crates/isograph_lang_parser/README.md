# `isograph_lang_parser`

## Overview of the language

The Isograph query language:

- compiles to fragment-less GraphQL queries,
- has support for fragment composition, and
- associates fragments with JavaScript.

In that sense, it is like Relay, if:

- everything was a resolver, and
- the language for writing queries/fragments differed from GraphQL.
