# `graphql_lang_types`

Types for when you parse a GraphQL schema or document.

This is incomplete: currently, it only includes types for part of a GraphQL schema file. Currently, the plan is to support the part of the GraphQL spec used for GraphQL schema files, and not for operations. It shouldn't be hard to support for operations, though.
